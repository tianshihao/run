 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,null,null,2]'
 *
 * You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of
 * exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree
 * without changing its structure.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
 * Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
 * Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3
 * makes the BST valid.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
 * Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
 * Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2
 * and 3 makes the BST valid.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
 * -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you
 * devise a constant O(1) space solution?
