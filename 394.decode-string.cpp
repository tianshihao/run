 * Testcase Example:  '"3[a]2[bc]"'
 *
 * Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
 *
 * The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the
 * square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed
 * to be a positive integer.
 *
 * You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra
 * white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may
 * assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits
 * are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input
 * like 3a or 2[4].
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never
 * exceed 10^5.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
 * Output: "aaabcbc"
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
 * Output: "accaccacc"
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
 * Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 30
 * s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets
 * '[]'.
 * s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
 * All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].
